Tux the definitely-not-a-penguin was walking down the streets of UW-Madison. He was on his way to CS400 in the Humanities building when he slid on some ice. At a high velocity, he smashed into one of those robot things that carry food. The robot thing tipped over. Suddenly, Bucky the Badger runs out from behind a tree with a giant red W.
Tux had never heard Bucky talk before was shocked when he started to yell at him. Bucky shouted, "Watch where you are going! These robots can't defend themselves!" Tux was very embarrassed and quickly picked the robot up so it could continue on its way.
After this incident Tux dedidcated his life for the rights and liberties of robots. He held protests and fundrasiers so that all robots could bee treated equally. His efforts earned him the presidential medal of honor.
After recieving the medal of honor, Tux was unsure on what he would do next. He had spent the last few months blowing away his earnings on Gordon's take out and he needed a source of income. He decided to write a novel about his journey to recieving the medal of honor. Only, he did not know how to write and that staged a huge problem. He did not have any moeny to hire someone to write for him either so he
just spent the rest of his days begging for money.
