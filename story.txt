Tux the definitely-not-a-penguin was walking down the streets of UW-Madison. He was on his way to CS400 in the Humanities building when he slid on some ice. At a high velocity, he smashed into one of those robot things that carry food. The robot thing tipped over. Suddenly, Bucky the Badger runs out from behind a tree with a giant red W.
Tux had never heard Bucky talk before was shocked when he started to yell at him. Bucky shouted, "Watch where you are going! These robots can't defend themselves!" Tux was very embarrassed and quickly picked the robot up so it could continue on its way.
After this incident Tux dedidcated his life for the rights and liberties of robots. He held protests and fundrasiers so that all robots could bee treated equally. His efforts earned him the presidential medal of honor.
